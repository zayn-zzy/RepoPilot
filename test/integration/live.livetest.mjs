// LIVE tests: drive the real CLI against the REAL model API (both backends),
// reading keys from .env. Real models are non-deterministic, so these assert
// robust behavioral invariants (a token is echoed; a file's content is reported
// after a real tool call) rather than exact text. Each test SKIPS cleanly when
// that backend's key isn't in .env, and RUNS when it is — so the same suite is
// safe in CI (no keys → all skip) and meaningful locally (keys → real coverage).
//
// Run just these with keys present:  node --test test/integration/live.test.mjs
